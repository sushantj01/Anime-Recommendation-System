# Anime-Recommendation-System
The "Anime Recommendation System" project implements a simple yet effective Content-Based Filtering recommendation system designed to suggest anime titles similar to a user's favorite. It analyzes the features (such as genre, description, or tags) of a given anime and uses vector similarity to find the most relevant recommendations.
